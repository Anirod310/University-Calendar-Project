# University-Calendar-Project

Project in which we create a simple calendar in several steps to hand on what we learned in the C programming module. The project is organized into 3 main parts : 
- Dates gestion and events creation.
- Calendar in the form of a linked list in C.
- Sorting a calendar chronologically by event start dates.
